# Listening and Notetaking

## How to stay focus and listen to lectures

- It is easy to get distracted during listening.
    - e.g. when taking notes, when looking at instructors, even when reading text on the slides

- Be cautious when trying to do the above and notice how my attention changes. 
- Try not to look at anything when listening.
    - Look at your own notes or hands for instance.
